    <h3 class="title">About Me</h3>
    <p>My main preference of work arrangements are solely remote. I like remote work because it offers more flexibility and autonomy, both in location and working hours. Remote work doesn't necessarily mean work from home. It could mean working from a coworking space, or internationally by taking advantage of remote work visas.

Born in New York and living in Miami, FL for over 7+ years. My nationality is Hispanic. Colombia is where most of my culture is rooted from. A mix of Spanish, African and indigenous influences that have melded together over the centuries since European colonization. I would really enjoy a temporary opportunity to work remotely in regions in the U.S that are cold in winter and chance of snow. Truly fond of the warm weather year round in Florida. Fluent speaker in English and Spanish. My choice of language to be the best worker in a company would have to be the English language.

Despite my minor imbalance since late December 2019. Due to small calcium crystals becoming loose from the lining in the inner ear canal. I am grateful to have had work experience prior to my MRI diagnosis. Has helped me endure many obstacles during my job search. I decided to pursue UI/UX Design to find a loophole out of the standard Customer Case Management in a retail environment. Adapting to Don Norman's design principles has made the standard 9 to 5 workday more alluring. Motivated me to set goals and iterate UI design for customers and employees interaction. This aspect of UI enables increased conversions and retention.

I would like to bring my skills and common knowledge to benefit the workforce in any company that gives me the opportunity to thrive. Thank you for considering my application. I would appreciate the opportunity to meet with you remotely or in office.

As the new year rolls out for 2023 I am really excited about finding a job to be comfortable in. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is one of the most common causes of vertigo. The sudden sensation that youâ€™re spinning or that the inside of your head is spinning. 

My main interests are the planet Sun, oceanography, plant medicine, and furry pets. Although I am a lover of all dogs, I have not let go of my pet cat. Best find ever in the front garden of my home. So, what does it mean to be the best version of yourself? As a UI designer or human means doing what brings you sense of happiness, purpose, and meaning.</p>
