  Don Norman's design principles set the standard that everyday things and technology should be functional, easy to use, and intuitive.

  	 <div class="main-content__subtitle">Diana is a human-centered designer that believes clarity of expression is important when it comes to interaction design. 
		 Entry-level experience, specializing in visual merchandise and graphic design. Diana enjoys caring for her pets, gardening, and reading about regenerative therapy.
		 Fluent in English and Spanish.</div>
          <div class="main-content__subtitle"> After Diana's relapse from anxiety she refused to rely on opiods to remedy and discovered a more human-centered approach in the field of plant medicine. 
		  Anxiety if not taken into consideration can impair the body and mind as much as stress can. Once Diana diagnosed her imbalance through an MRI she realized that no balance was attainable when the sensation of her head spinning because of loose particles called ("crystals") of calcium in the inner ear would not go away. She quickly learned that an active and healthy lifestyle heightened her sensory mobility. Throughout her recovery she discovered the importance of light physical activity and the regenerative properties of plant medicine. Age and gravity are not parallel to one another. So Diana has become very vain from the get go and tries her best care any day under the sun. Such as drinking water. "Quantum Energy Healing", "The life cycle of a plant", "Water & Hearty Drinks","Therapeutic effects of plant medicine".
