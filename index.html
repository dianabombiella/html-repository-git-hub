   The purpose of lorem ipsum is to create a natural looking block of text (sentence, paragraph, page, etc.) that doesn't distract from the layout. A practice not without controversy, laying out pages with meaningless filler text can be very useful when the focus is meant to be on design, not content. </div>

   <p>Adapting to Don Norman's design principles has made the standard 9 to 5 workday more productive and just about any day under the sun. Motivating me to set goals and designing interactions that make technology feel effortless. </p>
              <p> On a regular day I'm facilitating languages to humans. From Spanish to English or English to Spanish. Credits to Google Translate."</p>
              <p>A bit about me . . . I was Born in New York and now living in South Florida. Colombia is where most of my culture is rooted from and my nationality is Hispanic.
Despite my minor imbalance after many anxiety highs and lows since late December 2019 I immediately got a MRI diagnosis that detected tiny calcium crystals detached from the inner ear canal. 
I am grateful to have had work experience prior to my MRI diagnosis. Has helped me endure many obstacles throughout my job search.</p>
<p>I consider myself a Subject Matter Expert somedays. The following are topics I like:</p>
			   <p>"The life cycle of a plant", "What is EMF?","Building a connection with cats or dogs", "Water & Hearty Drinks","Therapeutic effects of Cannabis & Cannabinoids."</p>
