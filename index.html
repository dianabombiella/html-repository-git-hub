<p>My name is Diana and I speak English or Spanish. I was Born in New York and now living in South Florida for over a decade. Colombia is where most of my culture is rooted from and my nationality is Hispanic.
Despite my minor imbalance after many anxiety highs and lows since late December 2019 my MRI diagnosis detected tiny calcium crystals detached from the inner ear canal. 
I am grateful to have had work experience prior to my MRI diagnosis. Has helped me endure many obstacles during my job search and has innovated many opportunities. 

Adapting to Don Norman's design principles makes the standard 9 to 5 workday more productive and just about any day under the sun. Motivating me to set goals and designing interactions that make technology feel effortless.
